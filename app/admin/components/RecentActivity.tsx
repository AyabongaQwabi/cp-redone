// Since the original code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the component uses array methods like `every`, `some`, or `filter`
// which might use single-letter variable names as arguments to callback functions.
// I will add a placeholder component with common array methods to illustrate how to fix the undeclared variable errors.
// In a real scenario, the original code would be available and the fix would be more specific.
