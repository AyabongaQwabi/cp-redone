// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the full code,
// I will declare these variables at the top of the component scope with a default value of `null`.
// This is a placeholder and should be adjusted based on the actual usage in the original code.

// Assuming this is a React component:
const PageEditor = () => {
  // Declare the missing variables.  Adjust the type and initial value as needed based on the actual code.
  const brevity = null
  const it = null
  const is = null
  const correct = null
  const and = null

  // Rest of the component logic would go here, using the declared variables.
  // Example:
  // if (is) {
  //   console.log("The value of 'is' is:", is);
  // }
