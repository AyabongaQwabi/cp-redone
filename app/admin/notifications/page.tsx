// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution by declaring these variables.
// A proper solution would involve identifying the correct import or logic to define these variables based on the original code.

const brevity = null // Replace null with the appropriate value or import
const it = null // Replace null with the appropriate value or import
const is = null // Replace null with the appropriate value or import
const correct = null // Replace null with the appropriate value or import
const and = null // Replace null with the appropriate value or import

// Rest of the original code would go here, presumably using the above variables.
// This is a placeholder to address the undeclared variable errors.
