// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses array methods like `every`, `some`, or `filter`
// and the variables `it`, `is`, `correct`, and `and` are intended to be parameters
// in the callback functions of these methods.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution.

// Example of how the variables might be used and declared implicitly as parameters:

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const allPositive = myArray.every((it) => it > 0) // 'it' is the element being checked
const hasEven = myArray.some((is) => is % 2 === 0) // 'is' is the element being checked
const correctNumbers = myArray.filter((correct) => correct > 2) // 'correct' is the element being checked
const combinedCondition = myArray.every((and) => and > 0 && and < 10) // 'and' is the element being checked

// The 'brevity' variable is more ambiguous without context.  It could be a boolean,
// a string, or a number.  I'll assume it's a boolean related to displaying a shortened
// version of something.

const brevity = false // Or true, depending on the default behavior

// The rest of the UserAvatar.tsx code would go here, presumably using these variables.
// Since the original code is missing, I cannot provide a complete solution.
